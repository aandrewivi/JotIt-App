# JotIt-App

A cloud-native note-taking app built on Azure and AWS with full system design principles. It will be designed using real-world system design concepts. Built on both Azure and AWS cloud platforms using:

- Azure Static Web Apps / AWS S3
- Azure Functions / AWS Lambda
- Cosmos DB / DynamoDB
- Azure AD B2C / Amazon Cognito
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Cloud Monitoring & Auto Scaling


### Why this project?

This is a practical learning project to master:
- Full System Design (Scalability, Reliability, Fault-Tolerance)
- Serverless Architecture
- GitHub Integration & CI/CD
- Azure vs AWS cloud services comparison
- Real-world deployment workflows
